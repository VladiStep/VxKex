This document lists all the registry keys used by VxKex.

HKLM\Software\VXsoft\VxKex (key)
  InstalledVersion (REG_DWORD)
    Contains the version number of the currently installed VxKex.
  KexDir (REG_SZ)
    Contains a Win32 path representing the installation directory of VxKex.
	For example, C:\Program Files\VxKex
  LogDir (REG_SZ)
    Contains a Win32 path representing the machine-specific log directory of
	VxKex. This is used as a fallback in case the per-user value is not
	available.
  DisableLogging (REG_DWORD)
    If present and non-zero, no log files are created.
  DllRewrite (key)
    Contains REG_SZ values, named after official Windows DLLs.
	Neither the value names nor the value data have the .dll extension.
    The data in these values is a string that defines which VxKex DLL it gets
    translated to during DLL import rewriting (dllrewrt.c).

HKCU\Software\VXsoft\VxKex (key)
  LogDir (REG_SZ)
    Overrides the HKLM equivalent if present.
  DisableLogging (REG_DWORD)
    Overrides the HKLM equivalent if present.

HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options (key)
  {VxKexPropagationVirtualKey} (key)
    Used during VxKex propagation. The contents are the same as for a normal IFEO key.
	The propagation component inside KexDll substitutes this key for the normal IFEO
	key (see propagte.c).

  <program name>.exe (key)
	UseFilter (REG_DWORD)
	  From Windows 7 onwards, this value is used by NTDLL. The registry key structure
	  used in Image File Execution Options is prone to name conflicts, which is why
	  "UseFilter" was added. If this value is present and non-zero, the NTDLL loader
	  will enumerate the sub-keys of <program name>.exe. For each sub-key, the loader
	  will check whether there is a value named "FilterFullPath" (REG_SZ). If this
	  value's data contains the full path to the currently running executable, the
	  loader will behave as if the sub-key that contains "FilterFullPath" *is* the
	  IFEO key for the process.

	<arbitrary> (key)
	  FilterFullPath
	    See above.
	  GlobalFlag (REG_DWORD)
		The configurator sets/clears FLG_APPLICATION_VERIFIER in order to enable or
		disable VxKex.
	  VerifierFlags (REG_DWORD)
	    0x80000000 is set by the VxKex configurator (to disable page heap) when enabling
		VxKex. It is not otherwise read or used by VxKex.
	  VerifierDlls (REG_SZ)
	    Space separated list of DLLs to load as verifier providers.
		The configurator adds/removes "KexDll.dll" from this list to enable or disable
		VxKex for a particular program.
	  KEX_DisableForChild (REG_DWORD)
	    Normally, VxKex propagates to child processes (propagte.c).
		If this value is present and non-zero, VxKex will not propagate to child
		processes.
	  KEX_DisableAppSpecific (REG_DWORD)
	    VxKex may use app-specific hacks or patches to get certain applications to
		run. If this value is present and non-zero, VxKex will not use app-specific
		hacks or patches.
	  KEX_WinVerSpoof (REG_DWORD)
	    This value controls Windows version spoofing.
	    See the KEX_WIN_VER_SPOOF enumeration for valid values of this key.
	  KEX_StrongVersionSpoof (REG_DWORD)
	    This value is a bit-field containing additional options for the version spoofer.
		See the KEX_STRONGSPOOF_* definitions and verspoof.c for more information.
	  KEX_BreakOnHardError (REG_DWORD)
	    If this value is nonzero, VxKex will activate a debug breakpoint before displaying
		a hard error message box.
	  KEX_DisableDllDirectory (REG_DWORD)
	    If this value is nonzero, VxKex will disable the usage of the AddDllDirectory,
		RemoveDllDirectory and SetDefaultDllDirectories functions.
	  KEX_D3D12Implementation (REG_DWORD)
	    This value controls what the redirected DLL for "d3d12.dll" is.
		0: Let VxKex decide.
		1: Do not redirect d3d12.dll at all (e.g. user wants to supply his own D3d12
		   compatibility layer)
		2: Use KxDx.dll (just a stub)
		3: Use D12ms.dll (Microsoft D3D12on7)
	  KEX_DnsapiImplementation (REG_DWORD)
	    This value controls what the redirected DLL for "dnsapi.dll" is.
		0: Let VxKex decide.
		1: Do not redirect (use the dnsapi provided with Windows 7).
		2: Use dnsw8.dll (from Windows 8).
